AdoptOpenJDK is moving to the Eclipse Foundation, and changing our name to become the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium&quot;&gt;Eclipse Adoptium project&lt;/a&gt;.  Since that announcement there has been a great
deal of work behind the scenes by many people to prepare for the move.
Our &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2020/12/eclipse-adoptium-projects-ready-for-community-review/&quot;&gt;last update&lt;/a&gt; on plans
and the road ahead was in December, so time to give a quick update on progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the transition to Eclipse we have continued to &lt;a href=&quot;https://adoptopenjdk.net/releases.html&quot;&gt;deliver high quality runtimes&lt;/a&gt;
to millions of end users who depend upon AdoptOpenJDK to power their production workloads.  Our users are always at the
forethought of everything that we do, and we want the transition to be as smooth as possible, so we won’t rush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we described earlier, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/&quot;&gt;Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt; is a good fit for AdoptOpenJDK’s mission.  Eclipse
has a well-established governance model and rigorous development processes that match our ideals.  Much of the unseen work over
the last few months has been spent ensuring that all the necessary legal agreements and governance structures are in place at
Eclipse that retain the character and spirit of the AdoptOpenJDK community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the new structure we are establishing at Eclipse is the
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/adoptium-charter.php&quot;&gt;Adoptium Working Group&lt;/a&gt;.  The working group’s role is to provide
vital vendor-neutral governance structure, intellectual property management, information technology infrastructure, development
process oversight, and ecosystem growth to all the projects at Eclipse Adoptium.  Membership of the working group is a serious
undertaking, and we are proud to have an important set of founding members be part of that group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the migration, Eclipse Adoptium has been structured into technology projects.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.temurin&quot;&gt;Eclipse Temurin&lt;/a&gt; provides the build infrastructure and coordination of
our releases across the widest range of platforms and versions.  &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium.aqavit&quot;&gt;Eclipse AQAvit&lt;/a&gt;
implements the accomplishment of enterprise-grade quality, spanning functional correctness, security, and performance.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-temurin-compliance&quot;&gt;Eclipse Temurin-Compliance&lt;/a&gt; ensures the binaries we produce
are compatible with the applicable Java SE specification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The existing AdoptOpenJDK code is presently going through Eclipse’s intellectual property review as it transitions into these
new projects.  As code moves between Github repositories as part of that process, we continue to develop it, run our builds,
and release updates to our users as usual.  The goal is to transition the home of our code without disruption to developers or users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel to the technical work we are transferring ownership of our key resources to the Eclipse Foundation.  These resources
cover a broad range of categories, from cash in the bank to cloud account control, and from domain names to private key secrets.
By grounding these fundamental project assets in the Eclipse Foundation no single vendor has control of Adoptium’s future.  We
are passionate about protecting the neutrality of our open source efforts to ensure Adoptium’s runtimes remain secure, open,
and free for everyone forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we transition these resources we are also starting to build awareness of our new Adoptium brand.  This is a critical area where
we have been lucky to have strong community engagement, and have also engaged professional advice to guide us.  AdoptOpenJDK
is a highly recognizable brand at present, with a great reputation that we are grateful to have earned over the years.  As we
accelerate our growth at Eclipse we wish to cement that with a new brand that is reflected in our logo, website, documentation,
and user engagement efforts.  Expect to see more on this over the coming weeks as we roll out our new look.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, the success of AdoptOpenJDK can be attributed to a number of factors, but they are all rooted in the innovation and
creativity of our exceptional community members.  We continue to be very open to new ideas, trying things, and exploring
possibilities.  We are not afraid to try ideas that don’t work out, and believe that the wisdom of the crowd serves us well.
Let us know what you are thinking about on &lt;a href=&quot;https://adoptopenjdk.net/slack&quot;&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; or our
&lt;a href=&quot;https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/adoptium-pmc&quot;&gt;mailing lists&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully that gives you an idea about what has been, and continues to be happening as we transition from AdoptOpenJDK to
Eclipse Adoptium.  This is an important time in the project’s growth, and a very exciting time to be part of the community.  If you
see something that looks cool, or wrong, or have a better idea for how we should be doing something,
&lt;a href=&quot;https://adoptopenjdk.net/getinvolved.html&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt;.  If you want fun and want to engage in any aspect of what we are doing,
we always welcome people who can write, draw, code, speak, review, test, organize, and critique.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK 8u282, 11.0.10, and 15.0.2 Available]]></title><description><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK is happy to announce the immediate availability of AdoptOpenJDK 8u282, 11.0.10, and 15.0.2.

Binaries are available for download of OpenJDK and Eclipse OpenJ9 (with OpenJDK class libraries). As always, all binaries are thoroughly tested and available free of charge without usage restrictions on a wide range of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8253664?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20openjdk8u282%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC&quot;&gt;List of security fixes and other fixes in OpenJDK 8u282&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8253813?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%2011.0.10%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC&quot;&gt;List of security fixes and other fixes in OpenJDK 11.0.10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8253202?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%2015.0.2%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC&quot;&gt;List of security fixes and other fixes in OpenJDK 15.0.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/blob/master/doc/release-notes/0.24/0.24.md&quot;&gt;List of changes in Eclipse OpenJ9 0.24.0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New and Noteworthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;New Trust Stores&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you open an HTTPS connection to a web server, your browser has to decide whether it trusts the server’s certificate or not. To determine whether it can trust the certificate, the browser checks if the certificate was signed by a trusted CA (certificate authority). Well known CAs are &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thawte.com&quot;&gt;Thawte&lt;/a&gt;.  If it is, the connection is established after some further checks were successfully performed. If it is not, you get a warning, and you will be asked whether you want to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does the browser know which CAs to trust? It contains a list of trusted CA certficates; or it asks the operating system that has such a list, too. Java is no different. When you open a TLS connection to a server with Java, for example, using &lt;a href=&quot;https://openjdk.java.net/groups/net/httpclient/intro.html&quot;&gt;HttpClient&lt;/a&gt;, Java validates the server’s certificate. To decide whether to trust the server’s certificate or not, Java uses its own trust store that is contained in a file called &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;cacerts&lt;/code&gt;. So far, AdoptOpenJDK came with the trust store maintained by the OpenJDK project. Starting with 8u282, 11.0.10, and 15.0.2, this is no longer the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the years, we received numerous reports from users that could not connect with Java to a server while they had no problem with their browser or command line tools like &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;. Therefore, we have decided to deviate from OpenJDK and instead to align with Mozilla Firefox. From now on, AdoptOpenJDK’s trust store contains the same CA certificates as Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean AdoptOpenJDK is less secure than before because it can now connect to more websites than before? Absolutely not. &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA&quot;&gt;Mozilla’s CA certificate program&lt;/a&gt; is well regarded throughout the industry for its high standards and independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Freetype Unbundled On Linux&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you want to use AdoptOpenJDK on Linux, you have to install some libraries with your package manager (apt, dnf, …), while others come with AdoptOpenJDK. Starting with 8u282, 11.0.10, and 15.0.2, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freetype.org&quot;&gt;Freetype&lt;/a&gt;, a library to render fonts, is no longer bundled. Instead, it needs to be installed with the system’s package manager. You can do so using one of the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debian/Ubuntu/Mint: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;apt-get install libfreetype6 fontconfig fonts-dejavu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;yum install freetype fontconfig dejavu-sans-fonts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SLES/OpenSUSE: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;zypper install libfreetype6 fontconfig dejavu-fonts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operating system packages (deb, rpm) we provide automatically install those dependencies for you. Please see &lt;a href=&quot;/2021/01/prerequisites-for-font-support-in-adoptopenjdk/&quot;&gt;Prerequisites for Font Support in AdoptOpenJDK&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We unbundled Freetype because OpenJDK does not bundle it anymore, either. Another reason is that Freetype on its own is not sufficient to provide font support in AdoptOpenJDK on Linux. You need additional libraries and some fonts. By not including those, AdoptOpenJDK’s font support was like a pizza without any toppings: severely lacking. On top of that, you got an unhelpful NullPointerException if any of the required components were missing. This is now slightly better: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Exception in thread &amp;quot;main&amp;quot; java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError: /usr/lib/jvm/jdk-11/lib/libfontmanager.so: libfreetype.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Changed Compiler Levels&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenJ9 8 is now compiled with Visual Studio 2013 instead of Visual Studio 2010, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/visual-studio-2010&quot;&gt;that reached its end of life last summer&lt;/a&gt;. AdoptOpenJDK 8 has been compiled with Visual Studio 2013 for a while.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Prerequisites for Font Support in AdoptOpenJDK]]></title><description><![CDATA[Back in the day when everybody got their JDK from Sun and later Oracle it included an  assortment of fonts  that could be used in addition…]]></description><link>https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2021/01/prerequisites-for-font-support-in-adoptopenjdk/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2021/01/prerequisites-for-font-support-in-adoptopenjdk/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Back in the day when everybody got their JDK from Sun and later Oracle it included an &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/intl/font.html#lucida&quot;&gt;assortment of fonts&lt;/a&gt; that could be used in addition to the fonts installed on the host. OpenJDK has not bundled any fonts for years (if it ever has), and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk-11-relnote.html#Removed&quot;&gt;Oracle did away with the bundled fonts starting with Oracle JDK 11&lt;/a&gt;. Already with OpenJDK 9 &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/intl/font-configuration-files.htm&quot;&gt;font configuration files were removed except on Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has a couple of implications for OpenJDK distributions, including AdoptOpenJDK: Your system might need additional packages and configuration beyond the AdoptOpenJDK installation for proper font support, especially on Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;macOS, and Windows&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Font integration should work out of the box, no matter whether you are using binary builds (compressed tarballs, ZIP archives) or operating system packages (if available).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Linux&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Linux, you need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freetype.org/&quot;&gt;Freetype&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontconfig.org/&quot;&gt;Fontconfig&lt;/a&gt; to enable OpenJDK to discover and use fonts. If you have neither, you might stumble upon unhelpful exceptions like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;Caused by: java.lang.NullPointerException

    ... 36 more&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to that, you need some fonts. &lt;a href=&quot;https://dejavu-fonts.github.io&quot;&gt;DejaVu&lt;/a&gt; is a family of free fonts based on Vera and included in most (if not all) Linux distributions. This makes it a solid choice. The following commands should install all the necessary packages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Debian/Ubuntu/Mint: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;apt-get install libfreetype6 fontconfig fonts-dejavu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;RHEL/CentOS/Fedora: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;yum install freetype fontconfig dejavu-sans-fonts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;SLES/OpenSUSE: &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;zypper install libfreetype6 fontconfig dejavu-fonts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a desktop environment installed on your system, those packages should already be present, and there is nothing left to do. If you have installed AdoptOpenJDK &lt;strong&gt;using our operating system packages (rpm, deb)&lt;/strong&gt;, all necessary packages will automatically be installed starting with 8u282, 11.0.10, and 15.0.2 released in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;AIX&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On AIX, the situation is similar to Linux. You need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freetype.org/&quot;&gt;Freetype&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontconfig.org/&quot;&gt;Fontconfig&lt;/a&gt;, and fonts. On the systems available to us, everything came with the operating system and as such, Java could use the fonts out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Solaris&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Solaris, you need &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freetype.org/&quot;&gt;Freetype&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://fontconfig.org/&quot;&gt;Fontconfig&lt;/a&gt;, and fonts, too. You should be able to install those using:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;pkg install system/library/freetype-2
pkg install font/truetype/dejavu&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you have a desktop environment installed, all the necessary libraries should already be present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Checking the Font Support&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to test whether the font support works on your system, here is a small sample program that should output the name of fonts installed on your system if everything is alright:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;java&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-java&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token namespace&quot;&gt;java&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;awt&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

After a long period of work behind the scenes, the first batch of project proposals is ready for community review. At the Eclipse Foundation, the monolithic AdoptOpenJDK project will be split into multiple sub-projects under the umbrella of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/adoptium&quot;&gt;Eclipse Adoptium Top Level Project&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse AQAvit&lt;/strong&gt; encompasses all our activities around testing, especially the development of our &lt;a href=&quot;/2019/07/the-first-drop-introducing-adoptopenjdk-quality-assurance-aqa-v1-0/&quot;&gt;AQA test suite&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eclipse Temurin&lt;/strong&gt; (an anagram of “runtime”) focuses on building and releasing JDKs (that part that most folks associate with AdoptOpenJDK). Fun trivia fact is that Temurin is not only an anagram of “runtime” but is also a chemical compound, 1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid similar to caffeine with the bonus of being demonstratively non-habituating and clinically safe!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;gatsby-resp-image-wrapper&quot; style=&quot;position:relative;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;max-width:590px&quot;&gt;

The &lt;a href=&quot;https://openjdk.java.net/groups/conformance/JckAccess/&quot;&gt;TCK for Java SE&lt;/a&gt; is a proprietary technology of Oracle and must be run confidentially. The Eclipse Foundation and AdoptOpenJDK went to great lengths to reconcile Oracle’s requirements with the needs of the Adoptium community. The result is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-temurin-compliance&quot;&gt;Eclipse Temurin Compliance&lt;/a&gt; project, which governs access to TCK material and resources. We thank Eclipse Foundation’s Executive Director Mike Milinkovich and his team for reaching an agreement with Oracle and making this possible.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Community Review&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#6_2_2_Proposal&quot;&gt;Community review&lt;/a&gt; is an important step towards the creation of the projects. We are looking for your feedback on those proposals to refine and enhance them. If you are already a member of the Eclipse Foundation, please communicate your feedback via the forms on the project pages linked below. Everyone else can &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/TSC/issues/160&quot;&gt;comment on our GitHub issue that collects feedback about our move to the Eclipse Foundation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-aqavit&quot;&gt;Eclipse AQAvit Project Proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-temurin&quot;&gt;Eclipse Temurin Project Proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.eclipse.org/proposals/eclipse-temurin-compliance&quot;&gt;Eclipse Temurin Compliance Project Proposal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Road Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the community review has been successfully completed, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/projects/dev_process/#6_2_3_Incubation&quot;&gt;incubation phase&lt;/a&gt; begins. The objective of the incubation phase is to set up the projects, processes, and infrastructure. Incubation ends with the first formal release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We expect a first release of JDK binaries that have passed the respective TCK in H1 2021. It is very well possible that the first releases only include a subset of versions and platforms. We intend to migrate the remainder of versions and platforms until the end of 2021. In parallel, AdoptOpenJDK will continue to provide updates and new versions until the migration is complete. Afterwards, AdoptOpenJDK will be put into maintenance mode and stop releasing new binaries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK Welcomes Dragonwell]]></title><description><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK and Alibaba are happy to announce we have joined forces to build, test, and distribute  Dragonwell JDK  on AdoptOpenJDK's…]]></description><link>https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2020/11/adoptopenjdk-welcomes-dragonwell/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://blog.adoptopenjdk.net/2020/11/adoptopenjdk-welcomes-dragonwell/</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Nov 2020 13:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;AdoptOpenJDK and Alibaba are happy to announce we have joined forces to build, test, and distribute &lt;a href=&quot;http://dragonwell-jdk.io/&quot;&gt;Dragonwell JDK&lt;/a&gt; on AdoptOpenJDK’s infrastructure. For our users, this means more choice, including some exciting new features that are unique to Dragonwell. One example is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alibaba/dragonwell8/wiki/Wisp-Documentation&quot;&gt;Wisp&lt;/a&gt; that implements coroutines on the JVM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next weeks, the first releases of Dragonwell 8 and 11 are going to appear on AdoptOpenJDK’s website alongside existing binary offerings. Dragonwell can also be consumed like any other binary release built at AdoptOpenJDK through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://api.adoptopenjdk.net/&quot;&gt;AdoptOpenJDK API&lt;/a&gt;. The Dragonwell team is going to introduce Dragonwell JDK and its unique features in separate blog posts. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragonwell is a flavour of OpenJDK (like AdoptOpenJDK!). It is a TCK-certified [&lt;a href=&quot;#fn-tck&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fn-tck-ret&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;] implementation of Java for large-scale application deployments on Alibaba Cloud and elsewhere. As such, it is a drop-in replacement for any other OpenJDK variant and compatible with all the tools you know, like JDK Flight Recorder and JDK Mission Control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba remains committed to collaborating closely with the OpenJDK community and intends to upstream as many customizations as possible from Alibaba Dragonwell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Alibaba&lt;a name=&quot;fn-tck&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; performs the TCK certification, not AdoptOpenJDK. &lt;a href=&quot;#fn-tck-ret&quot; title=&quot;Go back to footnote 1 in the text&quot;&gt;↩︎&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK 8u275 and 11.0.9.1 Available]]></title><description><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK is happy to announce the immediate availability of AdoptOpenJDK 8u275 and 11.0.9.1.

The OpenJDK project identified regressions in OpenJDK 8u272 and 11.0.9 that could crash the virtual machine. These regressions have been fixed in 8u275 and 11.0.9.1. As always, all binaries are thoroughly tested and available free of charge without usage restrictions on a wide range of platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8255963?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%20openjdk8u275%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC&quot;&gt;List of security fixes and other fixes in OpenJDK 8u275&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8255887?jql=project%20%3D%20JDK%20AND%20fixVersion%20%3D%2011.0.9.1%20ORDER%20BY%20created%20DESC&quot;&gt;List of security fixes and other fixes in OpenJDK 11.0.9.1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because the regressions are not present in AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.9 with OpenJ9, there is no new version of AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.9 with OpenJ9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New and Noteworthy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A Note About Our Versioning&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;In some places, most notably in the version strings of our Linux packages, 11.0.9.1+1 is identified as 11.0.9+11.2. We know that this might cause confusion, but we cannot accommodate version numbers with four parts in every place. For example, &lt;a href=&quot;https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html&quot;&gt;Semver 2.0.0&lt;/a&gt;, which we expose in our API, does not allow for version numbers with four parts. And for RPM, 11.0.9.1+1 would be the same as 11.0.9+11 that we already released in October.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK 8u272, 11.0.9, and 15.0.1 Available]]></title><description><![CDATA[AdoptOpenJDK is happy to announce the immediate availability of AdoptOpenJDK 8u272, 11.0.9, and 15.0.1.

TLS 1.3 is automatically enabled &lt;del&gt;and will be negotiated for connections with servers supporting it&lt;/del&gt; (not anymore since &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8245476&quot;&gt;JDK-8245476&lt;/a&gt;). Previously, &lt;a href=&quot;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/332&quot;&gt;TLS 1.3 was only available on OpenJDK 11+&lt;/a&gt; or required the installation of additional packages such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openjsse/openjsse&quot;&gt;OpenJSEE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;CentOS/RHEL 6 Support Restored in AdoptOpenJDK 15&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;AdoptOpenJDK 15.0.1 will work on CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, again, by requiring only glibc 2.12 or newer. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues/2097&quot;&gt;AdoptOpenJDK 15 that we released last month only works on CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 because it required a more recent version of glibc&lt;/a&gt;. This change does not affect OpenJ9 which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/docs/openj9_support/&quot;&gt;supports only CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 and newer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropping support for glibc 2.12 was a misjudgement by us prompted by the fast-approaching &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.centos.org/About/Product&quot;&gt;end of life date for CentOS 6 on 30th November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, which we use for building and testing all OpenJDK versions. We promise to find a way to continue supporting systems with glibc 2.12 or newer &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/Build/Supported+Build+Platforms&quot;&gt;as long as OpenJDK supports it&lt;/a&gt;. We apologize to everyone that was impacted by our mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shenandoah Garbage Collector Enabled in AdoptOpenJDK 11&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Shenandoah Garbage Collector was backported to OpenJDK 11 by the OpenJDK project and is available from AdoptOpenJDK 11.0.9 onwards (&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/AdoptOpenJDK/openjdk-build/issues/2114&quot;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;). The supported platforms are x86_64, x86, and aarch64. Shenandoah is a low pause time garbage collector that reduces GC pause times by performing more garbage collection work concurrently with the running Java program. Please see &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/shenandoah/Main&quot;&gt;the OpenJDK wiki page on Shenandoah for details&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/189&quot;&gt;Shenandoah was introduced with OpenJDK 12 (JEP 189)&lt;/a&gt; and has since been enabled in AdoptOpenJDK. We do not offer Shenandoah in OpenJDK 8 because it is not part of the mainline OpenJDK codebase. If you need Shenandoah on OpenJDK 8, please use &lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.redhat.com/products/openjdk/overview&quot;&gt;a binary built by Red Hat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;AdoptOpenJDK 8u272 for Solaris Not Ready&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8255003&quot;&gt;JDK-8255003&lt;/a&gt;, there is no AdoptOpenJDK 8u272 for Solaris yet, because it cannot be built successfully. A patch is currently being reviewed, which should allow us to build and ship AdoptOpenJDK 8u272 for Solaris soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2020-10-28: Incorrect statement about automatic negotiation of TLSv1.3 removed.

We have been one of the last vendors to do so. With AdoptOpenJDK 15, we have dropped the Client VM on Windows/x64, too. On Windows/x64, the Server VM is the superior choice for all workloads. Furthermore, continuing to bundle the Client VM would have resulted in a reduced feature set for the users of the Server VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AdoptOpenJDK for Windows/x86 (32-bit) still includes both the Client and Server VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A Note on Binaries for 32-bit ARM&lt;a name=&quot;a-note-on-binaries-for-32-bit-arm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Welcome to our very special interpretation of Groundhog Day!

We’re in advanced discussions with a potential supplier of a cluster of Raspberry Pis and hope to resolve the shortage in time for the release of AdoptOpenJDK 15 in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re also making progress on AdoptOpenJDK 8 on 32-bit ARM with a proper Client VM. We’re releasing two builds of 8u265: the first one with interpreted mode (Zero VM) only and a second one (8u265&lt;strong&gt;.1&lt;/strong&gt;) with a Client VM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
